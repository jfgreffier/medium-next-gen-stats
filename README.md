Get rid of the old fashion informationless default medium stats and get Next Generation Stats.

Don't you think medium.com provides way less information that they should?
I got tired of waiting for them to make it better and decided to make it by myself.

This extension provides larger time period, daily/weekly/monthly views/claps, and, specially, describes which article was view in which period.

Have fun!
